# Data Science Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. We use machine learning techniques on a dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset contains features like age, gender, class, and fare. The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on these features.

This project demonstrates:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature transformations.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding key patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and preparing data for modeling.
4. **Machine Learning Modeling**: Using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to make predictions.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
